#### Symptom  
- Concern over attempted account hacking 

- A recovery link has been sent to the client without asking for it

- Activity has been noted on the account without the knowledge or permission of the owner

- Concerns about account access attempts from devices which do not belong to the account owner

#### Problem    
Securing the client's accounts from unauthorized access attempts.

#### Solution
Assist the client in setting up Two-Factor Authentication (if available, over 2-Step) and in using a one time password app to be the second factor of the process.

##### Two-Factor Authentication and Two-Step Verification
Set up the account with Two-Factor Authentication or Two-Step Verification. This solution is not available for every online account, but when it is, we should encourage the client to use it, adding a layer of security beyond their password. 

If your client is concerned about associating their phone number with the account, please read below.

Use https://twofactorauth.org/ as a reference to see what accounts present 2-Step or 2FA as an option. 

For some of our most requested sites, provide the following instructional links to the client and assist in guiding them through the setup:

   * Google: https://www.google.com/landing/2step/

   * Twitter: https://blog.twitter.com/2013/getting-started-with-login-verification

   * Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/help/413023562082171/

   * Microsoft: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/two-step-verification-faq

   * Yahoo: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN5013.html

##### One Time Password Apps
If 2-Factor Authentication is an option, please council the client in the use of One Time Password apps. 

| Note | 
|------|
| This is our recommended way of implementing 2-Factor Authentication because of its heightened security viability due to the use of both "something you know" (a password) and "something you have" (something on your person, in this case an installed one time password app). |

* Let the client know how OTPs work

   One Time Passwords (OTPs) are one-time use codes that act as a password for a single use. These codes are generated by an app on a device you own (like a mobile phone), and are only valid for a short period of time.

* Explain the options

   Google offers Google Authenticator, but there are free-and-open-source (FOSS) options like FreeOTP and OTP Authenticator as well. 

   * Google Authenticator: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en

   * FreeOTP: https://fedorahosted.org/freeotp/ 

   * OTP Authenticator: https://fossdroid.com/a/otp-authenticator.html

* Assure the client

   Only the device with the authenticator app installed will be able to generate the one time password codes, so as long as an attacker does not have the unlocked device at hand, the account should be safe. This option does not require data or a phone connection.

#### Comments
* Note that 2-Step Verification (2-Step) and 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) are subtly different from one another, and if the service offers a form of it, 2-Factor Authentication will be more secure.

   Like 2-Step, in 2FA two pieces are necessary to log in to an account. A password serves as the first piece; itâ€™s something you know, information supposedly only known to the user. In 2-Step, the second piece is usually something you know also. In 2FA, the second piece is something you have (a physical item, like a phone or security key) or something you are (characteristics inherent to you, like a fingerprint or retina pattern).
