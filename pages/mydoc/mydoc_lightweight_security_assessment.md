#### Symptom
- An organization is requesting assistance on digital security, but their request is not clear

- An organization would like to receive help to improve their practices, but we are unsure what their needs are

- An organization is asking for a lightweight security assessment

- An incident handler is looking for guidance to better evaluate the risks for an organization

#### Problem    
Organizations don't always know exactly what their main risks are. In other situations, what an organization considers to be the highest risk is not actually their main issue. Understanding what is important for an organization, and what their risks are, is key to successfully improving their digital security.

Through this article, we aim to provide guidance to incident handlers in performing a light risk assessment for Helpline clients.

#### Solution   
In order to prioritize the digital security work that needs to be done, there are important questions that must be answered. However, obtaining responses to these questions is not usually as simple as asking directly.

Clients will not always understand what we are asking. You should form appropriate questions uniquely for each client. Keep in mind that you are looking for the necessary information to reply to all of the questions. Try to make this a conversation rather than only a question and answer session.

Before arranging a call with the client, do your own investigation. Look for information on their website, try to understand what work the organization is doing. The more prepared you are before talking directly with the client, the more important details you will be able to obtain. Make sure you take detailed notes during the call or meeting.

Questions for you and the client to consider:

   1. What is the organization's mission?
      * Whom do they serve?
      * How do they make that happen? (Personel, offices, etc.)

      These questions should allow you to understand how the organization works and what their usual workflow is.

   2. What are their assets and what is their value?
      As with the other questions, asking this directly won't give you all the information you require. By knowing the mission and the way the organization works, you should be able to probe deeper and understand what specific assets the organization has. Try to understand what the organization has within the following items:

      * Web presence

      * Social media presence
   
      * Data (reports, HR violations, campaign information, documents, affiliations, list of members, list of donors etc.)
   
      * Digital communications (email, chat, phone, etc.)
   
      * Infrastructure (network, servers, laptops, etc.)
   
      * Locations (Physical security)

      While talking about assets you can also ask about the policies for the protection of those assets. Do they currently have any information security policies implemented? How do they manage new hires, visitors, contractors, or interns? 

      Even if the organization doesn't have formal policies, it's good to know if they have informal security policies.

      It's also important to understand the capacity of their staff. Have they received digital security training in the past? If so, was it effective? What did it cover?

   3. Who might object to the work you are doing?

      Through this question we are trying to understand who their adversary is. Usually, in our space, there will be more than one person or individual, therefore it is important to also understand who is the most likely to take action.

      This is a good time to ask if the client has had any previous incidents.

   4. What is the client most concerned about?

      It is always important to understand what the organization is most concerned about. Even if the analysis and evaluation show there are other more critical issues, asking this question (yes, we can ask this directly!) will sometimes reveal assets or practices that were not mentioned before.

After gathering all of this information from the client, you should have enough details to understand what threats are more likely for the organization to face. These most likely threats will serve as a starting point for you to draft a remediation plan solving the most critical issues first. 

Coordinate with your contact from the organization to decide how to best work with them for the remediation phase.
