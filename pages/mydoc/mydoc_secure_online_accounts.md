Two-step verification and better awareness of account security settings can help to protect these vulnerable accounts. If available, it is also important to keep track of all devices that have logged in to an account. 

#### Symptom    
- Concern about a social media or online account's vulnerability to hacking and compromise, primarily:
   * Google
   * Twitter
   * Facebook

- Recovery link sent to the client without them asking for it

- Evidence that the account is being used without the owner's knowledge

- Concern about account access attempts from devices not recognized by the account owner

#### Problem    
- Securing the account and making sure that only the account owner has access to it

#### Solution:  
- Add layers of security for greater protection
   * Help the client to set up two-step verification (also called two-factor authentication)
   * Provide recommendations for privacy and security settings 
   * Teach the use of strong passwords and password management 

**Two-Factor Authentication Resources**
   * Please view the [main document](./two_factor_authentication_recommendations.md) on Two-Factor Authentication for more information.
