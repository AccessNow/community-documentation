## Categories of Articles
Guides contain three distinct categories: Event & Incidents, Procedures & Policies, and Support. Within these categories we also have subcategories that help us more easily define our information.

For example, an Article for adjusting Facebook's privacy settings would be found under

   * *Type:* Articles 
      * *Category:* Support
         * *Subcategory:* Social Media Security
