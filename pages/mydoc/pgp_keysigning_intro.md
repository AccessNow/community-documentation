# PGP key signing Introduction
## Template to suggest key signing to enhance the web of trust and/or address a key tampering attack

### Body

Dear xxxxx,

I hope you are doing great.

I am [IH's name], a member of the Access Now Helpline Team. I am contacting you
to inform you that I am going to sign your public key. I have a copy of your public
key “[Client public key fingerprint]” and will sign it with my own key
“[your key fingerprint]” as part of the resolution of case [case number].

This operation consists in adding a cryptographic signature to your public key,
and is aimed at building and enhancing trust around the web and towards our
partners and users in the civil society.

Having your key signed is a way to avoid PGP key tampering attacks. In this kind
of attacks, a malicious actor creates a key that has an ID similar to your key
and publishes it online, to impersonate you, to create confusion among your
contacts, or even to read emails that have been sent to you but encrypted using
the fake key. This can be avoided by having your public key signed, as the fake
key will not be trusted and signed by your contacts. Signing a key is a way to
prove that the key owner is also the legitimate owner of the connected email
account. As a trusted member of civil society, I will gladly sign your public
key once you reply with your approval.

Please note that before uploading your public key to a keyserver, it is a good
idea to take a moment to consider whether you want the whole world to know that
you are using an encryption key, without the ability to remove this information
at a later time.

Even if you have no problem with your key being publicly available in the keyservers,
please consider that once i've signed it and you have updated it in the keyservers,
your connection with the Access Now Digital Security Helpline will become public,
so please let us know if you feel that this could entail any risks for you.

Kind Regards,
XXXXX
