# Set a client with Riseup's VPN using Bitmask
## How to assist a client (Linux or Android user) who needs a free VPN account

### Problem

The client needs a secure connection to the Internet.

### Solution

This article is focused in the configuration of Riseup Bitmask VPN. If you require a more comprehensive view on anonymity/censorship tools, or are looking for additional information on VPNs, check [this article](Circumvention_Anonimity_tools_list.md).

If you already decided Riseup Bitmask VPN is an appropriate solutions for the client, you can follow these steps:

- Provide the client with the Riseup links:
    - [Linux](https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn/how-to/linux)
    - [Android](https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn/how-to/android)

- If the client is not technical enough to follow the steps, set up a meeting time to assist.


### Comments

If the client needs VPN on a machine/device other than Andorid or Linux, we can consider to provide the client with Access Now VPN. (see Article #82).

Please keep in mind that this solution is for **exceptional** cases, when neither Tor nor pluggable transports work, and it can be provided only for temporary periods of time.
