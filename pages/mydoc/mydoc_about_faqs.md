## Current Status of Documentation

We are continuing to make public as much information as we can about how the Helpline operates. Of course, this takes time as the documents are produced and cleaned up for assessment. Not all of our available categories will have documents associated with them yet, but as we work through our internal documentation, we hope that won't be the case for long. We thank you for your patience, and welcome any feedback you have, by email or by contributing to our GitHub page.
