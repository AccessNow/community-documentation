#### Symptom   
Someone is asking for an account reactivation or deactivation
 
#### Problem   
- Is the person asking for assistance the legitimate owner of the account?

- How can I escalate the case to the platform? What information do I have to provide?

- What if the case is [outside of our mandate](#outsideMandate)?

#### Solution
In all account recovery or deactivation cases you must ensure that the person contacting the Helpline is the the owner of the account, or (particularly in cases where the owner has been incarcerated) the legal representative of the owner of the account. 

This is crucial to verify before proceeding, no matter how urgent the contact claims the case to be. Owners of accounts can usually be verified via vetting. Legal representatives can be more difficult, but a combination of vetting and legal documents may be used for verification. 

**Please note that for all account recovery or deactivation cases you should immediately submit a request via the normal public mechanism that the relevant platform provides. This should always be the first step.**

1. Questions to ask during the process of verifying identity:

   * Who is asking for help? What do we know about him/her/them?
   * What are the account details?
   * What were the last actions performed on the account?
   * What happened with the account?
   * Why do they need their account back or deactivated?
   * How were we introduced to this case?
   * Is there a third party that can endorse the account recovery or deactivation necessity?
   * Does the client have a secure email address to follow up on it?

2. Reporting Forms for Providers
 
 Remember, before escalating the issue to any provider, it is essential to make sure that the client has already submitted their issue through these standard links first.

3. Escalating Cases

   If the automated report did not succeed, or the situation is critical and we need urgent assistance, we can escalate the cases to the relevant team.

   * Facebook:

   * For Microsoft: Escalate to your direct superior.

4. When the client regains access to their account, advise them on how to improve the account's security level. Enable two-factor authentication where possible, and change the password to a new, stronger and more secure one.

#### <a name="outsideMandate"></a>Case is Outside Mandate

Sometimes, the request of the client is outside of our mandate. 

First, we need to get approval from our Technology Director or Deputy Helpline Manager to confirm the case is definitely outside mandate. Then, we need to draft a reply to the client that will require approval from a supervisor.

Some potential answers we could provide are:

1. Publicly available advice on how to secure the client's account:

   * Google: https://www.google.com/safetycenter/everyone/start/

   * Microsoft: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/default.aspx?ws=support

   * Skype: http://www.skype.com/en/security/ 


2. If the account was suspended because of the published content, we need to explain to the client that there are policies against such practices. The following resources may be of use.
