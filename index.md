# Access Now Digital Security Helpline Documentation

**As of June 2018, this website is not mantained. The mantained website can be found at [https://accessnowhelpline.gitlab.io/community-documentation/](https://accessnowhelpline.gitlab.io/community-documentation/)**

In this website you will find guides we use at Access Now Digital Security 
Helpline to handle different kinds of cases during our 24/7 operations.

If you run a digital security helpdesk or are just advising your friends about how to secure their online activities or respond to a digital security incident, you can find some useful tips and procedures in these guides.
