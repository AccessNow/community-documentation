# About this Documentation

The community documentation is for Access Now's Digital Security Helpline to ensure transparency and accountability in its work. These documents provide the guidelines we use for our incident handlers, and include guides and FAQs for our clients and friends of the Helpline. We hope to make public as much as we can about the Helpline's operations and look forward to incorporating your feedback! 

## Current Status of Documentation

It takes time to produce and edit our docs for publish here. Not all of our available categories will have documents associated with them yet, but as we work through our internal documentation, we hope that won't be the case for long. We thank you for your patience, and welcome any feedback you have, by email or by contributing to our GitHub page.

## Types of Documentation

### Articles
Articles are documents that provide advice for situations the Helpline's incident handlers encounter. These docs lead the handler through expected behaviors and modes of reaction for the specific scenario.

### FAQs

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are documents that answer the most asked or anticipated questions for a piece of software, hardware, process, or policy. Usually, but not always, FAQs are directly related to an Article or Guide and thus do not stand alone. If this is the case, the associated documents will be linked within the document. FAQs are geared toward the general public and Helpline clients. 

### Guides
Guides are step-by-step instruction manuals made to assist those that contact the Helpline move through the set up of a piece of software, hardware, process or policy.
